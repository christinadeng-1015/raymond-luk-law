These legally binding and enforceable agreements outline the rights, responsibilities, and obligations of each partner in the event of separation, including issues such as property division, support payments, and other financial matters. <br/><br/> Cohabitation Agreements are often put into place before cohabitation begins, but it can also be finalized after cohabitation has happened. If your circumstances change at any time during your relationship, it may be a good idea to review any existing Cohabitation Agreement to consider if more reasonable, up-dated terms are needed.

By outlining each partner's rights and obligations upfront, Cohabitation Agreements can help prevent costly and emotionally draining legal battles in the future. <br/><br/> Unlike married spouses, there is no legislated process for how common-law spouses divide property and assets, which means there is no statutory protection for a cohabiting spouse’s interest in property to which the other spouse holds title.

The first step to getting a divorce is separating from your spouse, which can be as simple as sending a text message expressing your wish to separate. Within the year, you should take steps to physically distance yourself from your partner, such as moving to another place, sleeping in a different room, having separate bank accounts, not engaging in any social events with your spouse, etc. After a year, you may file for a divorce and have your spouse served with divorce papers.
