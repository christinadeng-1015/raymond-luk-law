He made every complex legal concept easy to understand and never hesitated to walk us through the details with patience. We truly appreciated how transparent and straightforward he was throughout the entire process. Raymond’s dedication and hard work left a lasting impression on us, and we couldn’t be happier with the outcome. If you’re looking for a knowledgeable and reliable lawyer, Raymond is the one to go to.",

      "review": "I was helping my parents look for a lawyer who could also speak Cantonese and Raymond was recommended by a friend. I’m personally not familiar with legal terms or processes especially in Cantonese, but thankfully Raymond and his team were incredibly helpful throughout the whole process. Raymond patiently explained everything in English and Cantonese and that helped ease a lot of stress from my parents and I. Another plus is that all of the office staff can speak Cantonese/Mandarin/English, so whenever my parents needed anything they contacted the office directly.",

We are a young family dealing with a big move to the suburbs and Ray made the process very easy for us, by thoroughly explaining the transaction process with developer, financial implications within agreements, and timelines with banks and lawyers to close the purchase. Highly recommend his service for real estate purchases!",
