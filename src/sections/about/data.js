      "Raymond and his team helped me through a new home purchase and old home sale. The home purchase had a few snags along the way on the vendor's end that raised concerns, but Raymond made time to share advice and answer all questions I had. Also, due to some delays, Raymond and his team worked late to ensure all documents were submitted on time. I also appreciate the detailed explanations and extra tips Raymond provided to ensure I was as informed as possible. Lastly, the service fees are very competitive compared to other quotes I had received.",
